# B.I.L-E
B.I.L-E or Bread Incorporated Logistics Exterminator Is a passion project Rogue-like game where you play as a series of interns hired on to wear the B.I.L-E suit to try and take down Bread Incorporated's Rivals!

Currently the project is in a very early state, being shelved until I have both the skills and time to fully flesh it out and get back to work! Estimated to start up again once I graduate from CST!
